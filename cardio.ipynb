    "## Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. It is the leading cause of death in all over the world except in Africa. CVD may include hypertensive heart disease, stroke, angina, arrhythmia and heart failure etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it takes an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, accounting for 31% of total death worldwide. For patients with existing CVD conditions and symptoms, if proper treatment and intervention are administered, it is estimated that 75% of CVD deaths are preventable. Throughout the years, a large number of research are done in the area of risk factors that affects the chances of getting CVD. Some of the common risk factors identified are genetics, age, gender, tobacco use, alcoho use, physical activities, diet, sleep and stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "For patients who have not been diagnosed of CVD and who are experiencing symptoms of CVD, doctors will usually evaluate his/her risk based on individual risk factors. Further diagnosis can then be performed ,in the forms of electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise stress tests, echocardiogram, coronary angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT), depending on the suspected disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to predict if a person is suffering from CVD based on a few simple characteristics. The factors that are examined here will be age, gender, height, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, glucose level, tabacco use, alcohol use and physical activity. The project aims to leverage on machine learning techniques to effectively classify and detect CVD cases. It is intended to be used as a proof of concept that these factors can be used as a simple evaluation to tell if a potential patient may suffer from CVD. "
