## Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Detection

# Motivation
The aim of this project is to predict if a person is suffering from CVD based on a few simple characteristics. It aims to leverage on machine learning techniques to effectively classify and detect CVD cases. It is intended to be used as a proof of concept that these factors can be used as a simple evaluation to tell if a potential patient may suffer from CVD.
